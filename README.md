# bovada-monster-bet-automation
Automating placing all orders in monster bet in bovada using requests. 
1. To run this code for yourself simply enter your bovada credentials in the keys.py file. Then add your authorization token/ID from monster.bet. You can get this from going into developer tools in monster.bet
2. Next choose the sport you want to place bets in, make sure this is the same sport you have selected in your monster.bet account. And go to the Jupyter file for that sport. Right now I have only written the code for football and baseball. More coming soon.
3. Press run-all in that jupyter notebook and watch the magic happen. (You may change the wager amount constant in the execution code if you dont want to bet 90% of your account)
